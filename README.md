# Equipment-Checkout
Concept:
A minimalistic web app for checking out equipment my church owns.

This program will streamline communication and help avoid equipment sharing conflicts.
Systems like this will help the church teams scale with the size of the congregation while maintaining as much effeciency as possible.



Design:

Ease of use is the most important design consideration.

- A single issue centric design eliminates UI noise and distractions not relavent to what this is for.
- Matte black, red and white color scheme is consistent with elevate's aesthetic.
- Timestamps each checkout automatically to make the process quicker than previous platforms we have used.
